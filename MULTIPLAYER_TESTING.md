## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**WebSocket Connection Failed:**
```bash
# Check if AI server is running
curl http://localhost:8787/health

# Check WebSocket endpoint
curl http://localhost:8787/ws-stats
```

**Dashboard Not Loading:**
- Ensure serving from correct port (8787)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all module imports resolve correctly

**Mobile Connection Issues:**
- Confirm room ID matches between dashboard and mobile URL
- Check mobile browser network connectivity
- Verify WebSocket support in mobile browser

**Animation Performance:**
- Use F1 to toggle demo effects
- Performance mode auto-activates if FPS < 45
- Disable background particles in performance mode

### Network Configuration
