**Expected Behavior:**
- **ANIMATION SEQUENCE (2.5 seconds):**
  - "Player 2 Connecting..." notification appears
  - Dashboard smoothly transitions to dual-player layout
  - Player 1 view scales down to 50% width
  - Player 2 view slides in from right
  - Agent debate area expands with enhanced background
  - "DUAL PLAYER MODE ACTIVATED!" success indicator
  - Demo mode visual effects activate

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Mobile P1 ──┐     ┌──→ AI Server (Dual-Player Analysis)
            │     │     ↓
         WebSocket ──→ Dashboard (Animated Split View)
            │     │     ↓
Mobile P2 ──┘     └──→ Coordinated AI Decisions + Agent Debate
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**WebSocket Connection Failed:**
```bash
# Check if AI server is running
curl http://localhost:8787/health

# Check WebSocket endpoint
curl http://localhost:8787/ws-stats
```

**Dashboard Not Loading:**
- Ensure serving from correct port (8787)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all module imports resolve correctly

**Mobile Connection Issues:**
- Confirm room ID matches between dashboard and mobile URL
- Check mobile browser network connectivity
- Verify WebSocket support in mobile browser

**Animation Performance:**
- Use F1 to toggle demo effects
- Performance mode auto-activates if FPS < 45
- Disable background particles in performance mode

### Network Configuration

**Development Mode:**
- AI Server: `localhost:8787`
- WebSocket: `ws://localhost:8787/ws`
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:8787/dashboard.html`

**Production Mode:**
- Use environment variables for custom domains
- HTTPS requires WSS WebSocket connections
- Set CORS headers for cross-origin requests
